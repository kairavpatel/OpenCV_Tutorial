## Object_Tracking_Color
In this project, object can track or recognize from the color. There are three options (red, blue, green) to select the color, first select the color of the object and in video color will be automatic detected.
## Translational_Color 
In this project, user can do rotaional as well as linear translation and also able to see the color wise as well as total distribution of the pixels of image. Moreover, user can remove color channel of the image and also able to see the negative image of the original image.  
## Make_Color
In this tutorial, user can combine three colors (red, green, blue) precisely, and also able see the combined output.
## Find_Contours
In this project, user can able to find countours in the input image.
## Color Quatization
In this project, user can able to reduce the color of the image, by applying the Kmeans cluter number while running the script. This ultimately also reduced the memory occupation of the image.
## MAXRGB_Filter
In this project, user can indentify intensity of the three colors (Red, Green, Blue) into the video.
## Mouse_Event
In this project, user can see the color of the specific part of the image and perticular part can be selected by mouse.
## Rotaion_Change_Image
In this project, first-of-all two images should be selected, and this images will be rotated and simultaneously change also.
## Object_Motion_Tracking
In this project, object motion will tracked with help of the OpenCV inbuilt funtion : findcountour. 
## Change_Image
In this project, Two image atuomatically changes.
